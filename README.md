# HashTable

Check if an element is belong for a certain datastructre (search)
uses very efficant search with hash functions.
The core algorithm, add_element and is_belong, is a randmoized algorithm.
it may say that an element belongs to the structre thus it isn't, 
but with a great value from the time complexity.
to see the full probability compution check the additionl pdf files.
